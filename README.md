## PROJECT OVERVIEW
I came across this [Dribbble post](https://dribbble.com/shots/16386948-NFT-Marketplace-Header) showing a gallery of NFTs based on classical paintings by Michelangelo, among others, since I am fascinated by this artist's work, I wanted to showcase his top five works, paintings and sculptures.

## SETUP AND INSTALLATION
> git clone https://github.com/theudbaldus/masterspieces.git  
> npm install  
> npm run dev

## USAGE
Navigate between the works and the biography page.

## FEATURES
I wanted to enhance my skills in animation, so you can see entry and exit animations of images and text on the app.

I built this project with React, Tailwind CSS for styling, Framer Motion for the animations. This project was bootstrapped with Vite.
